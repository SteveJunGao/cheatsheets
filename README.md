This repo will record some theories, equalities, inequalities that I find important in machine learning. I will also add my notes on these stuff.

## Matrix Theory
- Determinant
- Rank
- SVD

## Information Theory
- Entropy
- Relative Entropy
- Mutual Information

## Integral
- Integral with Gaussian function family
- Integral in probabilities
